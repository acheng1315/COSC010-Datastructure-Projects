# COSC010-Datastructure-Projects
A repository with the projects built during my quarter of the Dartmouth COSC010 course Data Structures and Algorithms. Some notable projects include the Kevin Bacon game, a natural language processing and tagging design based on the Viterbi Algorithm, and a camera pixel painter that analyzes color.
