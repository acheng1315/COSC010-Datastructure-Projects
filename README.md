# COSC010-Datastructure-Projects
A repository with the projects built during my quarter of data structures and algorithms. Some notable projects include the Kevin Bacon game, a natural language processing design based on the Viterbi Algorithm, and a camera pixel painter that analyzes color.
These projects were designed as a part of the Dartmouth COSC010 course Data Structures and Algorithms.
